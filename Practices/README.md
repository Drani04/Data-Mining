PRACTICE 1 

Test the Law Of Large Numbers for N random normally distributed numbers with mean = 0, stdev=1: # Create an R script that will count how many of these numbers fall between -1 and and divide by the total quantity of N # You know that E(X) = 68.2% # Check that Mean(Xn)->E(X) as you rerun your script while increasing N 

Hint:  
1. Initialize sample size 
2. Initialize counter 
3. loop for(i in rnorm(size)) 
4. Check if the iterated variable falls 
5. Increase counter if the condition is true 
6. return a result <- counter / N N <- 30 

N <- 30 #Initialize the sample in 30 but can be any number
counter <- 0 
for(i in rnorm(N)){ #rnorm is a generator of random numbers
  if(i <= 1 & i >= -1){
    counter <- counter + 1 #the counter is uppgrader in 1 each time 
  } 
}
result <- counter / N  #the result is counter/the size of the sample result
result
