### Homework 1 Geometric cape
The ggplot2 layers are also called geom. Once the base configuration is done, you can add the geoms on top of each other. Example: a variable X is positioned on the X axis, a variable Y is positioned on the Y axis, it uses a third variable for the color fill of the final geometric figures. In the two additional lines it is established: first, the argument geom_point () indicates that one of the geometric elements to be positioned are points, without additional configurations; second, a smoothed trend line (using a linear regression procedure) that will display the linear trend of the point cloud is positioned - using the geom_smooth command (method = lm, linetype = 2). Do not forget that after the first line, the geometry functions must be added indicating a + sign.
